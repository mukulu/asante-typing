Place the remaining fingers on the keys beside them in a natural manner. So, the left little finger would be on A and the right little finger would be on the ; (semicolon) key. Use the right little finger to remove an error with ‚Üê key.</p><p>To type any key, press the key with the finger over it. Use one of the thumbs to press the space bar. Keep your eyes on the screen as you type. Do not look at the keyboard.</p><p>Proceed to the next lesson only when you can type with 2% or less errors and atleast 20 words/minute (WPM). Accuracy is more important than speed for a beginner.</p><p>Note:</p><p>With one hour practice every day, you can master typing in two weeks(up to Unit 15)! One more week for mastering numbers(up to Unit 21). The rest is for full keyboard mastery.</p>",

        "Vedanta": "Maya is a statement of the fact of this universe, of how it is going on. People generally get frightened when these things are told to them. But bold we must be. Hiding facts is not the way to remedy.",
        "Hyperspace": "To Riemann, Euclid's geometry was particularly sterile when compared with the rich diversity of the world. Nowhere in the natural world do we see the flat, idealized geometric figures of Euclid. Mountain ranges, ocean waves, clouds, and whirlpools are not perfect circles, triangles, and squares, but are curved objects that bend and twist in infinite diversity.",
        "On Painting": "The first thing to know is that a point is a sign which one might say is not divisible into parts. I call a sign anything which exists on a surface so that it is visible to the eye. No one will deny that things which are not visible do not concern the painter, for he strives to represent only the things that are seen.",
        "Philosophy": "Philosophy is the study of general and fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. Such questions are often posed as problems to be studied or resolved. Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument, and systematic presentation. Philosophical questions can be grouped into various branches. These groupings allow philosophers to focus on a set of similar topics and interact with other thinkers who are interested in the same questions.",
        "Relativity": "Lightning has struck the rails on our railway embankment at two places A and B far distant from each other. I make the additional assertion that these two lightning flashes occurred simultaneously. If I ask you whether there is sense in this statement, you will answer my question with a decided 'Yes.' But if I now approach you with the request to explain to me the sense of the statement more precisely, you find after some consideration that the answer to this question is not so easy as it appears at first sight.",
        "Information Technology": "Information technology is the use of computers to store, retrieve, transmit, and manipulate data or information. IT is typically used within the context of business operations as opposed to personal or entertainment technologies. IT is considered to be a subset of information and communications technology 'ICT'. An information technology system 'IT system' is generally an information system, a communications system or, more specifically speaking, a computer system including all hardware, software and peripheral equipment operated by a limited group of users.",
        "Technology": "Technology is the sum of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods or services. The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. Technology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced economies. Philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Technology is often a consequence of science and engineering, although technology as a human activity precedes the two fields.",
        "Science": "Science from the Latin word scientia, meaning 'knowledge' is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. Modern science is typically divided into three major branches that consist of the natural sciences, which study nature in the broadest sense, the social sciences which study individuals and societies and the formal sciences, which study abstract concepts. There is disagreement, however, on whether the formal sciences actually constitute a science as they do not rely on empirical evidence.",
        "Engineering": "Engineering is the use of scientific principles to design and build machines, structures, and other items, including bridges, tunnels, roads, vehicles, and buildings. The discipline of engineering encompasses a broad range of more specialized fields of engineering, each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of applied mathematics, applied science, and types of application. Engineering is often characterized as having four main branches, that is chemical engineering, civil engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering.",
        "The Internet": "The Internet 'or internet' is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite 'TCP/IP' to communicate between networks and devices. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the interlinked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web 'WWW', electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.",
        "Debugging": "Debugging is the process of finding and resolving bugs 'defects or problems that prevent correct operation' within computer programs, software, or systems. The terms 'bug' and 'debugging' are popularly attributed to Admiral Grace Hopper in the 1940s. While she was working on a Mark II computer at Harvard University, her associates discovered a moth stuck in a relay and thereby impeding operation, whereupon she remarked that they were 'debugging' the system. However, the term 'bug', in the sense of 'technical error', dates back at least to 1878 and Thomas Edison 'see software bug for a full discussion'.",
        "Programming": "Programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task. Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language 'commonly referred to as coding'. Different programming languages support different styles of programming 'called programming paradigms'. The choice of language used is subject to many considerations, such as company policy, suitability to task, availability of third-party packages, or individual preference. Ideally, the programming language best suited for the task at hand will be selected.",
        "Math Mystery": "The instructor was incredulous that this new student could add a hundred terms so quickly and he assumed that answer would be wrong. However, when all the other students had finally finished their work and placed their slates upon the table, the instructor turned Gauss' slate over and read the correct answer: five thousand and fifty. How had Gauss done it? Gauss noticed that the first term, one, and the last term, a hundred, added together to be a hundred and one. Then he realized that the second term, two, and the next-to-last term, ninety nine, also added together to be a hundred and one. In fact, if he kept adding pairs of terms in this manner, he would get fifty pairs of sums, each sum equal to a hundred and one. Fifty multiplied by hundred and one is five thousand and fifty.",
        "The Code Book": "The next morning, Rivest handed the paper to Adleman, who went through his usual process of trying to tear it apart, but this time he could find no faults. His only criticism was with the list of authors. 'I told Ron to take my name off this paper,' recalls Adleman. 'I told him that it was his invention, not mine. But Ron refused and we got into a discussion about it. We agreed that I would go home and contemplate it for one night, and consider what I wanted to do. I went back the next day and suggested Ron that I be the third author. I recall thinking that this paper would be the least interesting paper that I will ever be on.' Adleman could not have been more wrong. The system, dubbed RSA 'Rivest, Shamir, Adleman' as opposed to ARS, went on to become the most influential cipher in modern cryptography.",
        "Wikipedia": "Wikipedia abbreviated as WP, is a multilingual online encyclopedia created and maintained as an open collaboration project by a community of volunteer editors. It is the largest and most popular general reference work on the World Wide Web. It features exclusively free content and has no advertising. Wikipedia was launched on January fifteenth, two thousand and one, and was created by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger. With six point two million articles, the English Wikipedia is the largest of the more than three hundred Wikipedia encyclopedias. Overall, Wikipedia comprises more than fifty four million articles attracting one point five billion unique visitors per month. In two thousand and five, Nature published a peer review comparing forty two hard science articles from Encyclopedia Britannica and Wikipedia and found that Wikipedia's level of accuracy approached that of Britannica.",
        "Gammaray burst": "Gammaray bursts are extremely energetic explosions that have been observed in distant galaxies. They are the brightest and most energetic electromagnetic events known to occur in the universe. Most GRBs are billions of light years away from Earth, the explosions are both extremely energetic and extremely rare. A typical gammaray burst releases as much energy in a few seconds as the Sun will in its entire ten billion year lifetime. They are as rare as a few per galaxy per million years. It has been hypothesized that a gammaray burst in the Milky Way, pointing directly towards the Earth, could cause a mass extinction event. They were first observed in the late nineteen sixties. In October two thousand and eighteen, astronomers reported that a gravitational wave event detected in two thousand and seventeen, may have been produced by the same mechanism, that is the merger of two neutron stars.",
        "Africa": "Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most populous continent, after Asia in both cases. At about thirty million square kilometers including adjacent islands, it covers six percent of Earth's total surface area and twenty percent of its land area. With one point three billion people as of twenty eighteen, it accounts for about sixteen percent of the world's human population. Africa's average population is the youngest amongst all the continents; the median age in twenty twelve was nineteen point seven, when the worldwide median age was thirty point four. Despite a wide range of natural resources, the continent is the least wealthy per capita, in large part due to the legacies of European colonization in Africa and the Cold War. Despite this low concentration of wealth, recent economic expansion and the large and young population make Africa an important economic market in the broader global context.",
        "Eurasia": "Eurasia is the largest continental area on Earth, comprising all of Europe and Asia. Primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two continents is a historical social construct, as they have no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of the six, five, or four continents on Earth. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid mega block. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on paleomagnetic data. Eurasia covers around fifty five million square kilometres, or around thirty six percent of the Earth's total land area. The landmass contains well over 5 billion people, equating to approximately seventy percent of the human population.",
        "Americas": "The Americas is a landmass comprising the totality of North and South America. The Americas make up most of the land in Earth's Western Hemisphere and comprise the New World. Along with their associated islands, the Americas cover eight percent of Earth's total surface area and twenty eight percent of its land area. Humans first settled the Americas from Asia between forty two and seventeen thousand years ago. Decolonization of the Americas began with the American Revolution in the seventeen seventies and largely ended with the Spanish-American War in the late eighteen nineties. The Americas are home to over a billion inhabitants, two-thirds of whom reside in the United States, Brazil, and Mexico. The name America was first recorded in fifteen-zero-seven. The name was also used in the Cosmographiae Introductio, in reference to South America. America derives from Americus, the Latin version of Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci's first name.",
        "Antarctica": "Antarctica is Earth's southernmost continent. It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, It is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At fourteen million square kilometres, it is the fifth-largest continent and nearly twice the size of Australia. At zero point zero zero zero zero eight people per square kilometre, it is by far the least densely populated continent. About ninety eight percent of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages one point nine kilometre in thickness, which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula. It is the coldest, driest, and windiest continent, and has the highest average elevation of all the continents. Most of Antarctica is a polar desert, there has been no rain there for almost two million years, yet eighty percent of the world freshwater reserves are stored there, enough to raise global sea levels by about sixty metres if all of it were to melt."

The conversion factor 1.609344 for miles to kilometers is one of application of Fibonacci sequence. The first 21 Fibonacci numbers Fn are 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597 2584 4181 6765. When Fn is bidirectional the sequence becomes negative 21, 13, 8, 5, 3, 2, 1, and positive 1 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21. A closed form expression of Fibonacci leads to golden ratio of 1.61803 39887 etc. Some math puzzle books present as curious the value of 1 divide by 9899 which is 0.0001 0102 0305 0813 2134 55. The first few Fibonacci prime are 2, 3, 5, 13, 89, 233, 1597, 28657, 514229, etc.",
