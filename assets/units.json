      "guide": "<p>All the eight fingers except the thumbs should be placed on the home row. This is done by placing the left forefinger on F and the right forefinger on J. Place the remaining fingers on the keys beside them in a natural manner. So, the left little finger would be on A and the right little finger would be on the ; (semicolon) key. Use the right little finger to remove an error with ‚Üê key.</p><p>To type any key, press the key with the finger over it. Use one of the thumbs to press the space bar. Keep your eyes on the screen as you type. Do not look at the keyboard.</p><p>Proceed to the next lesson only when you can type with 2% or less errors and atleast 20 words/minute (WPM). Accuracy is more important than speed for a beginner.</p><p>Note:</p><p>With one hour practice every day, you can master typing in two weeks(up to Unit 15)! One more week for mastering numbers(up to Unit 21). The rest is for full keyboard mastery.</p><p>As you practice, you'll encounter terms related to Bible scriptures and Ignatian spirituality to inspire your learning.</p>",

        "Spiritual Exercises Annotation 1": "The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola are a compilation of meditations, prayers, and contemplative practices developed by the saint to help people deepen their relationship with God. For centuries in all kinds of religious houses and abodes of spiritual teaching they have been proved of very great service for the spiritual perfection of men. The annotations and rules are here given in their entirety, as translated from the original autograph of St. Ignatius. First Annotation. By this name of Spiritual Exercises is understood every way of examining one's conscience, of meditating, of contemplating, of praying vocally and mentally, and of performing other spiritual actions, as will be said later. For as strolling, walking and running are bodily exercises, so every way of preparing and disposing the soul to rid itself of all the disordered tendencies, and, after it is rid, to seek and find the Divine Will as to the disposition of one's life for the salvation of the soul, are called Spiritual Exercises. Second Annotation.",
        "Spiritual Exercises Annotation 2": "Fourth Annotation. The following Exercises are divided into four parts8 First, the consideration and contemplation on the sins; Second, the life of Christ our Lord up to Palm Sunday inclusively; Third, the Passion of Christ our Lord; Fourth, the Resurrection and Ascension, with three Methods of Prayer. Though four weeks are assigned to the four parts, it is not to be understood that each Week has necessarily seven or eight days. For, as it happens that in the First Week some are slower to find what they seek -- namely, contrition, sorrow and tears for their sins -- and in the same way some are more diligent than others, and more acted on or tried by different spirits; it is necessary sometimes to shorten the Week, and at other times to lengthen it. The same is true of all the other Weeks, seeking out the things according to greater or less need. However, the Exercises should be finished in thirty days, more or less. Fifth Annotation. It is helpful to the one who is giving the Exercises, not knowing the other's thoughts or sins, to be faithful in asking him what he has thought or felt on the matter proposed for contemplation or meditation.",
        "Ignatius Autobiography Excerpt 1": "Up to his twenty-sixth year the heart of Ignatius was enthralled by the vanities of the world. His special delight was in the military life, and he seemed led by a strong and empty desire of gaining for himself a great name. The citadel of Pampeluna was held in siege by the French. All the other soldiers were unanimous in wishing to surrender on condition of freedom to leave the place, as they saw clearly that it was impossible to hold out. Ignatius persuaded the commander to continue the defense. His comrades took him at his word, for he was a great encouragement to them by his example and words. When the day of assault came, Ignatius made his confession to one of the nobles, his companion in arms. The wall was breached. Ignatius stood ready to defend the breach. He was struck by a cannon ball; thus the conquerors took possession. When the citadel was surrendered, the French so admired his courage that they carried him handsomely to his quarters. It was not long before he found himself in a critical condition. He asked for some books to divert him, during his convalescence. He was given the life of Christ and a book on the saints. As he read them over and over again, he became more and more enthusiastic for the idea of imitating the holy austerities of the saints.",
        "Ignatius Autobiography Excerpt 2": "After spending some time at Manresa, he set out for Jerusalem, following the same method of living on alms, and visiting churches frequently. On his return to Europe, he met with opposition from those who misinterpreted his intentions. He was even imprisoned for a time. Undaunted by these difficulties, he pursued his studies at Barcelona, Alcala, Salamanca, and Paris, everywhere edifying his fellow-students, and drawing many souls to God. At Paris he knew those who were to become his first companions, and who joined him in deliberating about the foundation of his new order. They bound themselves by vow at Montmartre, August 15, 1534. Ignatius returned to Spain to restore his failing health, and occupied himself in the salvation of souls. After his health was restored he went to Venice, where he rejoined his companions, and was ordained priest, June 24, 1537. The following year they met at Rome, and began those deliberations which ended, September 27, 1540, in the definitive foundation of the Society of Jesus.",
        "Ignatius Letter to Jesuits 1": "To my dear Fathers and Brothers of the Society of Jesus in Portugal. Peace in our Lord. Although the distance which separates us is so great, dear Brothers, yet the union of charity which the Divine Goodness has given us in His holy service is such that we are always present to one another. For charity, as the Apostle says, is patient, is kind, thinks no evil, bears with all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Charity never fails. Hence it comes to pass that although absent in body we are present in spirit, taking part in one another's concerns. For the finger feels not its own pain alone, but that also of the other members. Thus has God in His goodness deigned to unite us, not only to Himself but also to one another, in such a way that each one feels in his own heart the concerns of all the others, and all together those of each one. This is a grace which we should esteem highly and preserve carefully. For it is certain that if we are thus united, no storms however violent will be able to shake us; but disunited, the slightest breeze will overthrow us. Let us then strive, dear Brothers, to preserve this union of hearts, this mutual communication of concerns.",
        "Ignatius Letter to Jesuits 2": "To the Fathers and Brothers of the Society in Coimbra. May the grace and peace of Christ our Lord be always with us. I received your letter, dear Brothers, and it gave me great consolation to hear of the good progress you are making in virtue and learning. Thanks be to God who is so liberal in His gifts. I was especially pleased to learn of the good example you are giving to the other students in the university, and how many are edified by your modesty, recollection, and devotion. This is a great apostolate, dear Brothers, to preach by example. Words move, but examples draw. Continue then in this way, and our Lord will bless you abundantly. As to the questions you ask about the manner of giving the Spiritual Exercises, I will answer briefly. First, the one who gives the Exercises should not incline the exercitant more to poverty or to a promise than to their opposites, nor to one state of life rather than to another. For although outside the Exercises we may lawfully and meritoriously urge every one who is probably fitted to choose continence, virginity, the religious life, and all manner of evangelical perfection",
        "Formula of the Institute Excerpt": "Whoever desires to serve as a soldier of God beneath the banner of the Cross in our Society, which we desire to be designated by the Name of Jesus, and to serve the Lord alone and the Church, his spouse, under the Roman Pontiff, the Vicar of Christ on earth, should, after a solemn vow of perpetual chastity, poverty and obedience, keep in mind that he is a member of a community founded chiefly for this purposek to strive for the defense and propagation of the faith and for the progress of souls in Christian life and doctrine, by means of public preaching, lectures and any other ministration whatsoever of the Word of God, and further by means of retreats, the education of children and unlettered persons in Christianity, the spiritual consolation of Christ's faithful through hearing confessions and administering the other sacraments. Moreover, he should show himself ready to reconcile the estranged, compassionately assist and serve those who are in prisons or hospitals, and indeed, to perform any other works of charity, according to what will seem expedient for the glory of God and the common good. Furthermore, all these works should be carried out altogether free of charge and without accepting any salary for the labor expended in all the aforementioned.",
        "Constitutions Part 1 Excerpt": "Although in the divine goodness and providence all things are directed to the service and praise of their Creator, nevertheless, speaking in a more particular sense, our little Society, which we desire to be called by the name Jesus, is founded chiefly for the defense and propagation of the faith and for the perfection of souls in Christian life and doctrine, by means of public preachings, lectures, and any other ministration whatsoever of the word of God, and further by means of the Spiritual Exercises, the education of children and unlettered persons in Christianity, the spiritual consolation of Christ's faithful through the hearing of confessions and administering the other sacraments. Moreover, this Society should show itself no less useful in reconciling the estranged, in holily assisting and serving those who are found in prisons or hospitals, and indeed in performing any other works of charity, according to what will seem expedient for the glory of God and the common good. All these works, however, are to be done altogether free of charge and without accepting any stipend. Furthermore, to prevent any wandering about through the world in search of lodging or revenues, or any other pretense, no one is to be admitted into this Society unless he renounces all right to possessions and determines to follow Christ the Lord in poverty, after the manner of the apostles.",
        "Bible Genesis 1 Excerpt": "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light7 and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was goodg and God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmamentI and it was so. And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day. And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear/ and it was so. And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas@ and God saw that it was good. And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earthn and it was so. And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself",
        "Bible Psalm 23 Full": "The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pasturesM he leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soulb he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil+ for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies* thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life2 and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever. This psalm, attributed to David, is one of the most beloved in the Psalter, often used in funerals and times of trial. It portrays God as a caring shepherd and generous host, emphasizing trust and provision. In Ignatian contemplation, one might imagine walking through the valley or sitting at the table, feeling God's presence. Jesuit reflections often link it to the Examen, reviewing day's 'pastures' and 'valleys.'",
        "Bible John 3 Excerpt": "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. He that believeth on him is not condemnedb but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God. This passage from John's Gospel, part of Jesus' conversation with Nicodemus, is central to Christian soteriology. Jesuits like Xavier used it in missions, emphasizing God's love. In Spiritual Exercises, it's contemplated in Week 4 on Resurrection joy.",
        "Catechism Paragraph 1-3": "God, infinitely perfect and blessed in himself, in a plan of sheer goodness freely created man to make him share in his own blessed life. For this reason, at every time and in every place, God draws close to man. He calls man to seek him, to know him, to love him with all his strength. He calls together all men, scattered and divided by sin, into the unity of his family, the Church. To accomplish this, when the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son as Redeemer and Savior. In his Son and through him, he invites men to become, in the Holy Spirit, his adopted children and thus heirs of his blessed life. So that this call should resound throughout the world, Christ sent forth the apostles he had chosen, commissioning them to proclaim the gospelZ 'Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, to the close of the age.' Strengthened by this mission, the apostles 'went forth and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by the signs that attended it.'",
        "Catechism Paragraph 27-30": "The desire for God is written in the human heart, because man is created by God and for God; and God never ceases to draw man to himself. Only in God will he find the truth and happiness he never stops searching forR The dignity of man rests above all on the fact that he is called to communion with God. This invitation to converse with God is addressed to man as soon as he comes into being. For if man exists it is because God has created him through love, and through love continues to hold him in existence. He cannot live fully according to truth unless he freely acknowledges that love and entrusts himself to his creator. In many ways, throughout history down to the present day, men have given expression to their quest for God in their religious beliefs and behaviorH in their prayers, sacrifices, rituals, meditations, and so forth. These forms of religious expression, despite the ambiguities they often bring with them, are so universal that one may well call man a religious being= From one ancestor MGodO made all nations to inhabit the whole earth, and he allotted the times of their existence and the boundaries of the places where they would live, so that they would search for God and perhaps grope for him and find him - though indeed he is not far from each one of us.",
        "Lives of Saints Francis Xavier": "Saint Francis Xavier was born in the castle of Xavier in Navarre on April 7, 1506. He was educated at the University of Paris, where he met Saint Ignatius of Loyola and became one of the first seven Jesuits who took vows at Montmartre in 1534. Ordained in 1537, he was sent to the East Indies in 1541 at the request of King John III of Portugal. He landed at Goa in 1542 and began his apostolic labors. He preached to the Portuguese colonists, visited prisons and hospitals, and catechized children. He then went to the Paravas on the Pearl Fishery Coast, where he baptized thousands. He traveled to Travancore, Malacca, the Moluccas, and Ceylon, everywhere preaching and converting. In 1549 he went to Japan, landing at Kagoshima, and founded missions there. He planned to enter China but died on the island of Sancian on December 3, 1552. His body was brought to Goa, where it remains incorrupt. He was canonized in 1622 and declared patron of missions in 1927. His letters reveal his burning zeal and tender charity.",
        "Breviary Morning Prayer Excerpt": "O God, come to my aid. O Lord, make haste to help me. Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen. Alleluia. Hymnr O God of truth and Lord of power, whose word their course to things assigns, whose splendour lights the morning hour, whose fiery sun at noonday shinesI Within us quench the wrong desire, the rising wrath within us stanch; and make our secret soul entire in strength of undivided ranch. Grant this, O Father ever One with Christ thy sole-begotten Son, and Holy Ghost, whom all adore, reigning and blest forevermore. Psalm 35 (36)J Sin speaks to the sinner in the depths of his heart. There is no fear of God before his eyes. He so flatters himself in his mind that he knows not his guilt. In his mouth are mischief and deceit. All wisdom is gone. He plots the defeat of goodness as he lies on his bed. He has set his foot on evil ways, he clings to what is evil. Your love, Lord, reaches to heaven; your truth to the skies. Your justice is like God's mountain, your judgements like the deep. To both man and beast you give salvation.",
        "Papal Encyclical Laudato Si Excerpt": "Saint Francis of Assisi reminds us that our common home is like a sister with whom we share our life and a beautiful mother who opens her arms to embrace us. Praise be to you, my Lord, through our Sister, Mother Earth, who sustains and governs us, and who produces various fruit with coloured flowers and herbs. This sister now cries out to us because of the harm we have inflicted on her by our irresponsible use and abuse of the goods with which God has endowed her. We have come to see ourselves as her lords and masters, entitled to plunder her at will. The violence present in our hearts, wounded by sin, is also reflected in the symptoms of sickness evident in the soil, in the water, in the air and in all forms of life. This is why the earth herself, burdened and laid waste, is among the most abandoned and maltreated of our poor; she groans in travail. We have forgotten that we ourselves are dust of the earth; our very bodies are made up of her elements, we breathe her air and we receive life and refreshment from her waters. Nothing in this world is indifferent to us.",
        "Vatican II Lumen Gentium Excerpt": "Christ is the Light of nations. Because this is so, this Sacred Synod gathered together in the Holy Spirit eagerly desires, by proclaiming the Gospel to every creature, to bring the light of Christ to all men, a light brightly visible on the countenance of the Church. Since the Church is in Christ like a sacrament or as a sign and instrument both of a very closely knit union with God and of the unity of the whole human race, it desires now to unfold more fully to the faithful of the Church and to the whole world its own inner nature and universal mission. This it intends to do following faithfully the teaching of previous councils. The present-day conditions of the world add greater urgency to this work of the Church so that all men, joined more closely today by various social, technical and cultural ties, might also attain fuller unity in Christ. The eternal Father, by a free and hidden plan of His own wisdom and goodness, created the whole world. His plan was to raise men to a participation of the divine life.",
        "Apostolic Fathers Clement Excerpt": "Let us therefore, brethren, be of humble mind, laying aside all haughtiness, and pride, and foolishness, and angry feelings; and let us act according to that which is written (for the Holy Spirit says, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, neither the rich man in his riches; but let him that glories glory in the Lord, in diligently seeking Him, and doing judgment and righteousness), being especially mindful of the words of the Lord Jesus which He spoke teaching us meekness and long-suffering. For thus He spoke( Be merciful, that you may obtain mercy; forgive, that it may be forgiven to you; as you do, so shall it be done unto you; as you judge, so shall you be judged; as you are kind, so shall kindness be shown to you; with what measure you measure, with the same it shall be measured to you. By this precept and by these rules let us establish ourselves, that we walk with all humility in obedience to His holy words. For the holy word says, On whom shall I look, but on him that is meek and peaceable, and that trembles at My wordsi It is therefore right and holy for us, men and brethren, rather to obey God than to follow those who, through pride and sedition, have become the leaders of a detestable emulation. For we shall incur no slight injury, but rather great danger, if we rashly yield ourselves to the inclinations of men who aim at exciting strife and tumults, so as to draw us away from what is good.",
        "Church Fathers Augustine Confessions Book 1 Excerpt": "Great are You, O Lord, and greatly to be praised; great is Your power, and of Your wisdom there is no end. And man, being a part of Your creation, desires to praise You, man, who bears about with him his mortality, the witness of his sin, even the witness that You resist the proud, - yet man, this part of Your creation, desires to praise You. You excite him thereto, that it should delight him to praise You, for You have made us for Yourself, and restless is our heart until it comes to rest in You. Grant me, O Lord, to know and understand whether first to invoke You or to praise You; whether first to know You or call upon You. But who can invoke You, knowing You note For he who knows You not may invoke You as another than You are. It may be I should invoke You, that I may come to know You. But how shall they call on Him in whom they have not believedK Or how shall they believe without a preacherD And they shall praise the Lord who seek Him. For they that seek shall find Him, and they finding Him shall praise Him. I will seek You, O Lord, and call upon You.",
        "Summa Theologica Aquinas Question 1": "It was necessary for man's salvation that there should be a knowledge revealed by God besides philosophical science built up by human reason. Firstly, indeed, because man is directed to God, as to an end that surpasses the grasp of his reasonv The eye hath not seen, O God, besides Thee, what things Thou hast prepared for them that wait for Thee (Is. 66Y4). But the end must first be known by men who are to direct their thoughts and actions to the end. Hence it was necessary for the salvation of man that certain truths which exceed human reason should be made known to him by divine revelation. Even as regards those truths about God which human reason could have discovered, it was necessary that man should be taught by a divine revelation; because the truth about God such as reason could discover, would only be known by a few, and that after a long time, and with the admixture of many errors. Whereas man's whole salvation, which is in God, depends upon the knowledge of this truth. Therefore, in order that the salvation of men might be brought about more fitly and more surely, it was necessary that they should be taught divine truths by divine revelation.",
        "Teresa of Avila Interior Castle Excerpt": "I began to think of the soul as if it were a castle made of a single diamond or of very clear crystal, in which there are many rooms, just as in Heaven there are many mansions. Now if we think carefully over this, sisters, the soul of the righteous man is nothing but a paradise, in which, as God tells us, He takes His delight. For what do you think a room will be like which is the delight of a King so mighty, so wise, so pure and so full of all that is goodN I can find nothing with which to compare the great beauty of a soul and its great capacity. In fact, however acute our intellects may be, they will no more be able to attain to a comprehension of this than to an understanding of God; for, as He Himself says, He created us in his image and likeness. Now if this is so - and it is - there is no point in our fatiguing ourselves by attempting to comprehend the beauty of this castle; for, though it is His creature, and there is therefore as much difference between it and God as between creature and Creator, the fact that His Majesty says it is made in His image and likeness means that we can hardly form any conception of the soul's great dignity and beauty.

        "Therese of Lisieux Story of a Soul Excerpt": "I often asked myself why God had preferences, why all souls did not receive an equal measure of grace. I was astonished to see that He showered extraordinary favours on great sinners like St. Paul, St. Augustine, but I did not understand His ways. It was only when I began to study the Gospels more attentively that I came to understand that what seems impossible to us is very simple for our Lord, since He is the Master of His own works and is not bound by any law. I saw too that since the time of His coming the Kingdom of God has been preached, and everyone uses force to enter it. Our Lord has saidk 'The Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force.' And againy 'Be not afraid, little flock, for it has pleased your Father to give you the Kingdom.' Then I understood that our Lord does not call those who are worthy but those whom He pleases, as He says to the mother of the sons of Zebedee7 'To sit on My right or left hand is not Mine to give to you, but to them for whom it is prepared by My Father.' I believe that the 'little flock' are those who are little in the eyes of the world, and whom God makes great by His grace.",
        "Vatican II Sacrosanctum Concilium Excerpt": "Mother Church earnestly desires that all the faithful should be led to that fully conscious and active participation in liturgical celebrations which is demanded by the very nature of the liturgy. Such participation by the Christian people as a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a redeemed people, is their right and duty by reason of their baptism. In the restoration and promotion of the sacred liturgy, this full and active participation by all the people is the aim to be considered before all else; for it is the primary and indispensable source from which the faithful are to derive the true Christian spirit; and therefore pastors of souls must zealously strive to achieve it, by means of the necessary instruction, in all their pastoral work. Yet it would be futile to entertain any hopes of realizing this unless the pastors themselves, in the first place, become thoroughly imbued with the spirit and power of the liturgy, and undertake to give instruction about it. A prime need, therefore, is that attention be directed, first of all, to the liturgical instruction of the clergy.",
        "Code of Canon Law Canons 1246-1248": "Canon 1246. v1 The Lord's day, on which the paschal mystery is celebrated, is by apostolic tradition to be observed in the universal Church as the primary holyday of obligation. In the same way the following holydays are to be observedv the Nativity of Our Lord Jesus Christ, the Epiphany, the Ascension of Christ, the feast of the Body and Blood of Christ, the feast of Mary the Mother of God, her Immaculate Conception, Assumption, the feast of Saint Joseph, the feast of the Apostles Saints Peter and Paul, and the feast of All Saints. d2 However, the conference of bishops may, with the prior approval of the Apostolic See, suppress certain holydays of obligation or transfer them to a Sunday. Canon 1247. On Sundays and other holydays of obligation, the faithful are obliged to participate in the Mass. Moreover, they are to abstain from those works and affairs which hinder the worship to be rendered to God, the joy proper to the Lord's day, or the suitable relaxation of mind and body. Canon 1248. *1 The obligation of assisting at Mass is satisfied wherever Mass is celebrated in a catholic rite either on a holyday itself or on the evening of the previous day.",
        "Roman Missal Preface of Lent I": "It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God. For by your gracious gift each year your faithful await the sacred paschal feasts with the joy of minds made pure, so that, more eagerly intent on prayer and on the works of charity, and participating in the mysteries by which they have been reborn, they may be led to the fullness of grace that you bestow on your sons and daughters. And so, with Angels and Archangels, with Thrones and Dominions, and with all the hosts and Powers of heaven, we sing the hymn of your glory, as without end we acclaims Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts. Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.

        "Roman Martyrology December 3": "The third day of December. The commemoration of Saint Francis Xavier, priest of the Society of Jesus and confessor, who, born of noble parentage in Navarre, was one of the first companions of Saint Ignatius, and was sent by Saint John the Third, king of Portugal, to the Indies, where he converted many nations to the faith of Christ, wrought many miracles, and departed to God on the island of Sancian. His body was translated to Goa, and his festival is kept by order of Alexander the Seventh, pope. At Alexandria, the holy martyr Claudius, who, under Decius the emperor, was cruelly tortured by the command of the judge Arianus, and at last beheaded. At Tangiers in Morocco, Saint Cassian, martyr, who, after having been a judge for a long time, at last, through the revelation of an angel, believing in Christ, was put to death by the executioners whose duty it was to kill criminals. At Rome, Saint Birinus, bishop, who, sent from Rome by Pope Asterius, converted the West Saxons to the faith, and died happily in the time of Pope Honorius the First. At Chur in Switzerland, Saint Lucius, king of the Britons, who, in the time of the emperor Marcus Antoninus, was the first of the British kings to receive the faith of Christ, together with his people. At Milan, Saint Mirocles, bishop and confessor, of whom mention is made by Saint Ambrose.",
        "Denzinger Enchiridion Symbolorum Excerpt": "The Nicene Creed/ We believe in one God the Father almighty, maker of all things visible and invisible; and in one Lord Jesus Christ the only-begotten Son of God, born of the Father, that is, of the substance of the Father, God of God, light of light, true God of true God, born not made, of one substance with the Father (which in Greek is called homoousios), by whom all things were made which are in heaven and on earth, who for us men and for our salvation came down, took flesh, was made man, suffered, rose again the third day, ascended into heaven, and is coming to judge the living and the dead. And in the Holy Spirit. But those who say/ There was a time when he was not, and he was not before he was begotten, and he was made from nothing, or who profess that he is from another substance or essence, or that the Son of God is created or changeable or alterable, the catholic and apostolic church anathematizes. This creed was promulgated at the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD to combat Arianism and affirm the divinity of Christ.",
        "Butler Lives of Saints January 1": "The circumcision of our Lord was performed in obedience to the law of Moses, on the eighth day after his birth. The eternal Son of God, having taken upon him our human nature, subjected himself to all the precepts of the law, though he was the sovereign legislator. By this wonderful condescension he confounded the pride of Satan, who fell through pride, and set us an example of perfect humility and obedience. The name of Jesus, which signifies Saviour, was given him on this occasion, as had been commanded by the angel. This adorable name claims our profound respect and devotion. It is the name above every name, at which every knee should bow. In it we find all good; it is the object of our hope, our comfort in affliction, our strength in temptation, our refuge in danger. Let us invoke it with confidence and love. The mystery of the circumcision teaches us to mortify our flesh, to cut off all inordinate affections, and to offer to God the first-fruits of our hearts. It also reminds us of the painful circumcision of the heart, which is necessary to remove the roots of sin. Let us implore the grace to accomplish this spiritual circumcision, that we may become true Israelites, a people according to God's heart.",
        "Roman Pontifical Ordination Rite Excerpt": "My son, you are about to be promoted to the order of priesthood. Consider carefully the ministry to which you are to be advanced. It will be your duty to sanctify the Christian people by divine worship, especially by the celebration of the sacraments. You will exercise the teaching office in the name of Christ the Head and Shepherd. You will fulfill the ministry of the word worthily and wisely, namely, by preaching the Gospel and explaining the Catholic faith. In carrying out the ministry of orders, remember that you are a co-worker with the order of bishops, by whom you are called to serve the people of God. With the help of the Lord Jesus Christ, our God and High Priest, strive to bring the faithful together into one family, so that you may lead them to God the Father through Christ in the Holy Spirit. Keep always before your eyes the example of the Good Shepherd, who came not to be served but to serve, and who came to seek out and to save what was lost. Receive now the Gospel of Christ, whose herald you have become. Believe what you read, teach what you believe, and practice what you teach. This rite from the Roman Pontifical outlines the duties and spiritual commitments of the priest during ordination.",
        "Directory for Catechesis Excerpt": "The ministry of the word is a fundamental element of evangelization through all its stages, because it involves the proclamation and the hearing of God's word, which calls for a response of faith. The catechist is called to be a witness of faith and a teacher of the word. Catechesis is an essential moment in the process of evangelization. It is a process that leads to maturity of faith through a journey of initiation and formation. The Directory for Catechesis, published in 2020 by the Pontifical Council for Promoting the New Evangelization, emphasizes the kerygmatic dimension, the importance of digital culture, and the role of the family in catechesis. It highlights that catechesis is not merely instruction but an encounter with Christ. The catechist must be formed in Scripture, doctrine, and pedagogy, always centered on the person of Jesus. Special attention is given to catechesis for persons with disabilities, migrants, and those in irregular situations. The directory calls for a renewed commitment to adult catechesis as the axis around which all other forms revolve.",
        "Compendium of Social Doctrine Paragraph 1-2": "The Church's social doctrine is an integral part of her evangelizing ministry. Nothing that concerns the community of men and women - situations and problems regarding justice, freedom, development, relations between peoples, peace - is foreign to evangelization, and evangelization would be incomplete if it did not take into account the mutual demands continually made by the Gospel and by the concrete, personal and social life of man. Profound links exist between evangelization and human promotiono 'These ... are linked by many close bondsi the bond of their common origin, since both come from God; the bond of their single objective, namely, the glory of God and the good of man; the bond of their common means, which is the message of the Gospel'. The object of the Church's social doctrine is essentially the same that constitutes the reason for her existenceA the human person called to salvation, and as such entrusted by Christ to the Church's care and responsibility. By means of the social doctrine, the Church shows her concern for human life in society, aware that the Gospel, lived in its personal and social dimensions, is the unique and irreplaceable foundation for building a just society and for the integral development of every person.",
        "Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii Gaudium Excerpt": "I dream of a missionary option, that is, a missionary impulse capable of transforming everything, so that the Church's customs, ways of doing things, times and schedules, language and structures can be suitably channeled for the evangelization of today's world rather than for her self-preservation. The renewal of structures demanded by pastoral conversion can only be understood in this lightp as part of an effort to make them more mission-oriented, to make ordinary pastoral activity on every level more inclusive and open, to inspire in pastoral workers a constant desire to go forth and in this way to elicit a positive response from all those whom Jesus summons to friendship with himself. As John Paul II once said to the Bishops of Oceania3 All renewal in the Church must have mission as its goal if it is not to fall prey to a kind of ecclesial introversion. The parish is not an outdated institution; precisely because it possesses great flexibility, it can assume quite different contours depending on the openness and missionary creativity of the pastor and the community. While certainly not the only institution which evangelizes, if the parish proves capable of self-renewal and constant adaptivity, it continues to be the Church living in the midst of the homes of her sons and daughters.",
        "Rerum Novarum Encyclical Excerpt": "To Our Venerable Brethren the Patriarchs, Primates, Archbishops, Bishops, and other ordinaries of places having Peace and Communion with the Apostolic See. That the spirit of revolutionary change, which has long been disturbing the nations of the world, should have passed beyond the sphere of politics and made its influence felt in the cognate sphere of practical economics is not surprising. The elements of the conflict now raging are unmistakable, in the vast expansion of industrial pursuits and the marvellous discoveries of science; in the changed relations between masters and workmen; in the enormous fortunes of some few individuals, and the utter poverty of the masses; the increased self reliance and closer mutual combination of the working classes; as also, finally, in the prevailing moral degeneracy. The momentous gravity of the state of things now obtaining fills every mind with painful apprehension; wise men are discussing it; practical men are proposing schemes; popular meetings, legislatures, and rulers of nations are all busied with it - actually there is no question which has taken deeper hold on the public mind. Therefore, venerable brethren, as on former occasions when it seemed opportune to refute false teaching, We have addressed you in the interests of the Church and of the common weal, and have issued letters bearing on political power, human liberty, the Christian constitution of the State, and like matters, so have We thought it expedient now to speak on the condition of the working classes.",
        "Ignatian Rules for Discernment 1": "First Rule. The first rule8 In the persons who go from mortal sin to mortal sin, the enemy is commonly used to propose to them apparent pleasures, making them imagine sensual delights and pleasures in order to hold them more and make them grow in their vices and sins. In these persons the good spirit uses the opposite method, pricking them and biting their consciences through the process of reason. Second Rule. The second* In the persons who, on the contrary, go earnestly purging their sins and rising from good to better in the service of God our Lord, it is the method contrary to that in the first Rule, for then it is the way of the evil spirit to bite, sadden and put obstacles, disquieting with false reasons, that one may not go on; and it is proper to the good spirit to give courage and strength, consolations, tears, inspirations and quiet, easing, and putting away all obstacles, that one may go on in well doing. Third Rule. The third1 Of Spiritual Consolation. I call it consolation when some interior movement in the soul is caused, through which the soul comes to be inflamed with love of its Creator and Lord; and when it can in consequence love no created thing on the face of the earth in itself, but in the Creator of them all. Likewise, when it sheds tears that move to love of its Lord, whether out of sorrow for one's sins, or for the Passion of Christ our Lord, or because of other things directly connected with His service and praise.",
        "Ignatian Rules for Discernment 2": "Fourth Rule. The fourthd Of Spiritual Desolation. I call desolation all the contrary of the third rule, such as darkness of soul, disturbance in it, movement to things low and earthly, the unquiet of different agitations and temptations, moving to want of confidence, without hope, without love, when one finds oneself all lazy, tepid, sad, and as if separated from his Creator and Lord. Because, as consolation is contrary to desolation, in the same way the thoughts which come from consolation are contrary to the thoughts which come from desolation. Fifth Rule. The fifthL In time of desolation never to make a change; but to be firm and constant in the resolutions and determination in which one was the day preceding such desolation, or in the determination in which he was in the preceding consolation. Because, as in consolation it is rather the good spirit who guides and counsels us, so in desolation it is the bad, with whose counsels we cannot take a course to decide rightly. Sixth Rule. The sixth= Although in desolation we ought not to change our first proposals, it is very helpful intensely to change ourselves against the same desolation, as by insisting more on prayer, meditation, on much examination, and by giving ourselves more scope in some suitable way of doing penance. Seventh Rule.",
        "Ignatius Spiritual Diary Entry": "February 2, 1544. During Mass, from the beginning until after Communion, great devotion, many tears, speech somewhat impeded. Afterwards, a great lucidity of mind concerning the matter of the poverty of the house. It seemed to me that I saw or felt the Divine Essence, as something round, or in a similar shape, but much larger than the sun, from which proceeded the rays that gilded the saints. At times, this Essence appeared to be somewhat raised, sending forth flames of fire like rays. I wept much and sobbed, unable to contain myself. It seemed to me that I was raised up in spirit, with a great increase of devotion and of burning love. I remained thus for a long time. February 3. During the whole day, great devotion and tears, especially when thinking of the poverty. February 4. From morning till after dinner, great devotion and many tears. After dinner, when going to the Cardinal's, great lucidity concerning the matter of poverty, with devotion and spiritual quiet. February 5. During Mass, great devotion and tears. Afterwards, lucidity concerning poverty. February 6. During the whole day, devotion and tears, especially concerning poverty. February 7. The same as yesterday. February 8. The same. February 9. The same, with greater intensity.",
        "Directory to Spiritual Exercises Excerpt": "The director ought not to urge the exercitant more to poverty or promise of it, than to the contrary, nor to one state or way of life more than to another. For although, outside of the Exercises, we may lawfully and meritoriously urge all who are fitted for it to choose continence, virginity, the religious life, and all manner of evangelical perfection, still in such Spiritual Exercises it is more suitable and much safer in seeking the divine will that the Creator and Lord in person communicate Himself to the devout soul in quest of the divine will, that He inflame it with His love and praise, and dispose it for the way in which it could better in future serve Him. So, he who is giving the Exercises should not turn or incline to one side or the other, but standing in the centre like a poise, leave it to the Creator to act immediately with the creature, and the creature with its Creator and Lord. For this end it will be well for him who is giving the Exercises to have a faithful account from the exercitant of the latter's whole life up to the present, not only regarding his deeds, by a general confession if advisable, but much more regarding his desires and inclinations. For it is according to these that the election is to be made.",
        "Monumenta Ignatiana Volume 1 Preface": "The Monumenta Historica Societatis Iesu, of which this is the first volume, aim to collect and publish all documents related to the origins and early history of the Society of Jesus. This series, begun in 1894, includes letters, instructions, and historical narratives from St. Ignatius and his companions. The importance of these documents lies in their revelation of the spiritual and administrative genius of Ignatius, as well as the rapid expansion of the order. Volume 1 contains the letters of St. Ignatius from 1537 to 1546, numbering 124 documents. These letters cover topics such as the foundation of the Society, missions to various countries, and spiritual advice to individuals. The edition is based on original manuscripts preserved in the Jesuit archives in Rome. Critical notes and introductions provide context and variants. This collection is indispensable for scholars of Jesuit history and Ignatian spirituality, offering primary sources for understanding the charism and development of the order in its first decades."
