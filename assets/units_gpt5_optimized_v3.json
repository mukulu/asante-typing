Place the remaining fingers on the keys beside them in a natural manner. So, the left little finger would be on A and the right little finger would be on the ; (semicolon) key. Use the right little finger to remove an error with ← key.</p><p>To type any key, press the key with the finger over it. Use one of the thumbs to press the space bar. Keep your eyes on the screen as you type. Do not look at the keyboard.</p><p>Proceed to the next lesson only when you can type with 2% or less errors and atleast 20 words/minute (WPM). Accuracy is more important than speed for a beginner.</p><p>Note:</p><p>With one hour practice every day, you can master typing in two weeks(up to Unit 15)! One more week for mastering numbers(up to Unit 21). The rest is for full keyboard mastery.</p><p>As you practice, you'll encounter terms related to Bible scriptures and Ignatian spirituality to inspire your learning.</p>",
