  Asante Typing – a web‑based typing tutor that combines the pedagogical
  approach of Klavaro with the lesson structure of QuickQWERTY. It uses a
  unified two‑pane layout with a persistent menu on the left and a guide or
  practice area on the right. Lessons are stored in JSON and can be extended.
