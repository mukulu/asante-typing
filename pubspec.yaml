description: |
  A webâ€‘based typing tutor inspired by the Klavaro typing tutor but
  organised around the lesson structure of the QuickQWERTY project.  
  This Flutter project consumes the QuickQWERTY unit definitions and
  presents them in an accessible, responsive user interface suitable
  for web deployment.  It focuses on correctness, timing metrics
  and intuitive progression through the curriculum.
